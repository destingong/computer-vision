A practical Streamlit implementation to explore computer vision tasks and transformer models, including but not limited to:
1. Image Classification: Analyze images and assign them to one or more predefined categories or classes, utilizing model architectures like ViT (Vision Transformer).
2. Image Segmentation: Classify image pixels into specific categories, creating detailed masks that outline object boundaries, including DETR and Mask2Former model architectures.
3. Image Captioning: Generates descriptive text for images, demonstrating models like visual encoder-decoder and BLIP that combine visual encoding with language generation capabilities.
4. Visual Question Answering (VQA): Process both image and text queries to answer open-ended questions based on image content, comparing architectures like ViLT (Vision Language Transformer) with its token-based outputs and BLIP with more coherent responses.
